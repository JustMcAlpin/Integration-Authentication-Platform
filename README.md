Integration Authentication Platform
This app connects Google, Microsoft, Twilio, and SendGrid accounts. It uses OAuth 2.0 or API keys, stores credentials securely, and gives users a simple way to see whatâ€™s connected.

Whatâ€™s Working
Google (Calendar, Drive, Sheets, Gmail)

Microsoft (Mail, Calendar, OneDrive)

Twilio (SID + Auth Token)

SendGrid (API Key)

Credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM, and the encryption key is provided via local gradle.properties or env vars. Nothing is hardcoded.

Whatâ€™s Not
I didnâ€™t implement Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, or X. They either require third-party app approval, secret-based auth, or extra backend setup â€” and this was already a huge scope for a take-home project.

If you want to see those platforms integrated: pay me. ðŸ˜‡

Setup
Clone the repo

Copy gradle.properties.example â†’ gradle.properties

Fill in the real values (donâ€™t commit them)

Build and run

Notes
Some earlier commits included placeholder values that looked like real credentials. They werenâ€™t. GitHub flagged them anyway â€” theyâ€™ve since been removed or whitelisted.
